# DCP-Registration-Module
v1.0 - A simple registration code for any website. 

The installation is based off of simple PHP and MySQL queries. The code will check for discrepancies in matching usernames, emails, and IP addresses, along with options for custom fields.

The module comes with an experimental mathematics-based CAPTCHA security system. It was primarily designed to shield repeat bot attacks (yet is an experimental piece which may need to be patched).

The code comes with an installed SQL for a custom website per request.
